Hello there welcome to the 'Retro blogs | Blog - website'.

In this project I have used React JS as front end and Node JS as my backend and used Mongodb as my database.
Mainly I wanted to create a blog website like this one https://preview.colorlib.com/#magdesign and tried to make it as simple as possible.

The features I include in this project are...

1) Admin login and management.
2) Firebase login and Custom login for admin.
3) Admin dashboard where admin can access all the data.
4) User dashboard.
5) Responsive.
6) animations.
